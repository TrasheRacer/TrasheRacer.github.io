Imagine a software patch which makes your app compliant with policy to decarbonise the economy. What does such a patch look like?

### The Captured Carbon Based Economy

Lets say that next week the EU enacts legislation to move the Euro onto the Sequestered Carbon Standard (SCS).
Just as national economies abandoned the gold standard in the 20th Century, states now agree that each euro is redeemable for:
* X tonnes underground coal
* Y kilogrammes captured carbon
* Z square kilometers rainforest
* ...

Burning barrels of oil to power a grid becomes seen as the obscene luxury it is. 
Supplemented by nuclear fission, renewable energy become the dominant power source.
Power for computer systems gets less reliable (where renrewable sources depend on local weather conditions) as well as more expensive.

### Decarbonised software engineering

The goal of softare engineering is to build reliable software that solves a real-world problem.
Climate change affects all aspects of our lives in ever more significant and unpredictable ways.
In the interest of doing our best job as proffessionals, we should consider it's impending impact upon our field.
We must start to view the generation of energy via carbon combustion as the unaffordably destructive toxic excess it is, and design software accordingly.
