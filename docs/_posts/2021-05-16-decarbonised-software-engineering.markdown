Imagine a software patch which decarbonizes your application. What does this patch look like?

### The Captured Carbon Based Economy

Lets say that the EU enacts legislation to move the Euro onto the Sequestered Carbon Standard.
Via legislation mirroring the abandonment of the gold standard by central banks in the 1970s, European nations agree that each Euro has a **theoretical** exchange value equal to:
* X tonnes underground coal
* Y kilogrammes captured carbon
* Z square kilometers wild forest
* ...

Overnight our mentality shifts: burning barrels of oil to power a grid becomes seen as the absolute luxury it really is.
Supplemented by nuclear fission, renewable energy become the dominant power source.

How is our use of computers to be sustained under this environment?
We are accustomed to continuous availability of our power grid under high load, but (in most places) renewable electricity generation is only available under favorable weather conditions.
Technological adaptions to mitigate this through power storage are possible but expensive, often with heavy carbon costs via the required raw materials.

A better solution would be to adapt as a society, using our technology more sustainably.

### Decarbonized software engineering

The goal of softare engineering is to build reliable software to solve real-world problems.
Climate change affects all aspects of life in ever more significant and unpredictable ways.
Right now is a good a time as any to re-evaluate the grounding principles of our discipline.
We must begin to see the fossil-fuel electricity generation as the unaffordable & destructive toxic excess it actually is.
