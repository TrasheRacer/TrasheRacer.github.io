#### Living in the present

I bought Scranton's book after reading [this article](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com</2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/) relating his experiences fighting in Iraq.
He paints a vivid picture of an unravelling society, and describes well his manner of coping with an unpredictable and hostile environment.
I am a little envious of his calm and collected detachment to mortality; I am not religious and thus I am starved of a philosophy to guide me through these troubling times.
An eager disciple, I emulate his approach: I close my eyes and visualise my inevitable death.

I feel my lungs shudder their last and fail as I choke alone in a crowded Covid ward.  
I lie in a plush bed and hold my wife's hand, eyes peacefully closed, purring cat warming my lap.  
I see a viscous red smear across tarmac, myself a mangle of broken bones and degloved skin and burning motorcycle.  
It makes me feel calm. It even makes me feel good.  

The coming decades and centuries will see the global climate become something warm and wet in a way never before experienced by people, not experienced by the planet for the last three million years.
We will face the violent collapse of social strucutres developed over generations and a once-stable climate become harsh and unpredictable.
Although the traumatic breakdown of nation and empire is far from unprecedented in human history, although ours is the first genration to face the sheer *certainty* of our own civilisational demise.

People like me, living privileged in rich industrialised cities, are still insulated from the reality of our situation. 
We experience the slow demise of our known world in the abstract, through the pile-on of increasingly bleak news headlines.
I explore my own responses to our certain fate through meditation, a practice completely self-centred; not entirely unlike the system of exploitative capitalism behind this grand catastrophe (of which I am of course complicit in).

This tangled headspace is nightmarishly hard to navigate for me, with a univeristy degree, working at the cutting edge of our species' technological advancement.
What hope does that leave for those living a normal life with a family and kids and a service-industry job, without access to my education and free time for masturbatory pondering?

To repurpose a quote from James Bridle `you shouldn't need to be a plumber to be able to safely take a shit` - you shouldn't need to battle questions of existential dread to be able to find comfort and meaning in a life at the climax of humanity's last golden age.

I wonder how our collective mindset change will change as we are forced face-to-face with the horror to come.
Perhaps we will take solace in eachother and confront our collective doom with pride and dignity.

Will some cataclysmic awakening rip the veil from our eyes and ignite the fury in our hearts?  
Do we finally wreak savage justice upon those liars and pirates and thieves and cold-hearted crooks, who still profiteer from the rape and plunder of the biosphere?  
Are shining glass skyscrapers and gleaming super-yachts one day to raze and burn and sink?

I find it more likely that we each beat an individual retreat into an opaque tangle of facile social connections, our anger skillfully misdirected and comodified by black-box algorithms.
I see our societies fragment and splinter, to precipitate anew around conspiracy theories and fake news. Masses of people only a little more difficult to manage than well-fed & trusting cattle.

Only time will tell.  
What an exciting time to be alive!
