### Looking down the dark barrel

I bought Scranton's book after reading his [article](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com</2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/) relating his experiences fighting in Iraq.
He paints a vivid picture of an unravelling society and his way of coping with an unpredictable and hostile environment.

> To survive as a soldier, I had to learn to accept the inevitability of my own death.
> For humanity to survive in the Anthropocene, we need to learn to live with and through the end of our current civilisation.
> Change, risk, conflict, strife, and death are the very processes of life, and we cannot avoid them.
> We must learn to accept and adapt.
>
> -- Roy Scranton, Learning to Die in the Anthropocene

As they say, there are no atheists in the trenches.
In bad need of a prophet, I am drawn to the detached honesty of the author's mortal reckoning.
Inspired, I close my eyes and visualize my own inevitable demise:

_I feel my lungs shudder their last and fail as I choke alone in an overcrowded COVID ward._

_I sink deep in a plush bed surrounded by loved ones, eyes peacefully closed, a cat purring warmly beside me._

_I see a viscous red smear across tarmac, myself a mangle of broken bones and de-gloved skin and burning motorcycle._

It calms me. It fills me with pleasantly unexpected wellbeing.

### The final golden age

Our future ain't looking so great:

- Rising temperature (average)
- More extreme weather: storms, heatwaves, floods...
- Infrastructure collapse: power grid, internet, sanitation...
- Political/social instability: mass migration, resource wars, crop failure...

We are seeing the global climate become something warm and wet in a way never before experienced by human beings, nor experienced by our planet for the last three million years.
We face the violent collapse of social structures developed over generations, a once-stable climate turned harsh, inhospitable and unpredictable.
Although the traumatic breakdown of nation and empire is far from unprecedented in human history, although ours is the first generation to face the _certain_ collapse of our civilization.

### Thinking the Anthropocene

People like me, living privileged in rich industrialized cities, remain (temporarily) insulated from the reality of our situation.
We experience the slow demise of our known world in the abstract, through the pile-on of ever more bleak news headlines. What is to be done but meditate on our stifling lack of agency?

This tangled headspace is a nightmare to navigate, even for someone highly educated and working at the cutting edge of human technological advancement.
What hope does that leave for those living a normal life, family and kids and a service-industry job, without access to my education and free time for masturbatory pondering? To repurpose a quote from James Bridle:

>  You shouldn't need to be a plumber to be able to safely take a shit

One shouldn't need to battle questions of existential dread to be able to find comfort and meaning, leading a life through the climax of humanity's last golden age.

I wonder how our collective mindset change will change as we are forced face-to-face with the devestation to come.
Perhaps we will take solace in each other, confronting our collective doom with pride and dignity.

Will some cataclysmic awakening rip the veil from our eyes and ignite the fury in our hearts? Are we ever to wreak savage justice upon the liars, pirates, thieves and cold-hearted crooks, still profiteering by the rape and plunder of the biosphere?
Shall we live to see skyscrapers and super-yachts and all monuments to greed annihilated?

Or do we each beat an individual retreat into an opaque tangle of facile social connections, our anger skillfully misdirected and monetized via black-box algorithms?
Do our social structures fragment and splinter, precipitating anew around conspiracy theories and fake news? Only time will tell.
