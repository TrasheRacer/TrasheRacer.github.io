### Looking down the dark barrel

I bought Scranton's book after reading his [article](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/) relating his experiences fighting in Iraq.
He paints a vivid picture of an unravelling society, and describes how he developed a means to cope with an unpredictable and hostile environment.

> To survive as a soldier, I had to learn to accept the inevitability of my own death.
> For humanity to survive in the Anthropocene, we need to learn to live with and through the end of our current civilisation.
> Change, risk, conflict, strife, and death are the very processes of life, and we cannot avoid them.
> We must learn to accept and adapt.
>
> -- Roy Scranton, Learning to Die in the Anthropocene

They say there are no atheists in the trenches.
Like a freelance disciple latching onto a prophet, I'm drawn toward the detached honesty of the author's mortal reckoning.
Inspired, I close my eyes and visualize my own inevitable demise:

_I feel my lungs shudder and fail as I choke my last breath in an overcrowded ICU._

_I sink deep in a plush bed surrounded by loved ones, eyes peacefully closing._

_I smear viscous and red across black tarmac, mangled bones and shredded skin and burning motorcycle._

It calms me. It fills me with pleasantly unexpected wellbeing.

### The final golden age

Our future ain't looking so great:

- Rising average global temperature
- More extreme weather: storms, heatwaves, floods...
- Infrastructure collapse: power grid, internet, sanitation...
- Political/social instability: mass migration, resource wars, crop failure...

We are seeing the global climate become something warm and wet in a way never before experienced by human beings, nor experienced by our planet for the last three million years.

We face the violent collapse of social structures developed over generations, a once-stable climate turned harsh, inhospitable and unpredictable.
Although the traumatic breakdown of nation and empire is far from unprecedented in human history, ours is the first generation of people to ever face the _certain_ collapse of our civilization.

### Thinking the Anthropocene

People like me, living privileged in rich industrialized cities, remain (temporarily) insulated from the reality of our situation.
We experience the slow demise of our known world in the abstract, through the pile-on of ever more bleak news headlines. What is to be done but meditate on our stifling lack of agency?

This tangled headspace is a nightmare to navigate, even with years of higher education, even for those working at the cutting edge of human technological advancement.
What hope does that leave for those living a normal life, family and kids, service-industry job, without my education or my free time devoted to masturbatory pondering?

A quote of James Bridle comes to mind:

>  You shouldn't need to be a plumber to safely take a shit

Nobody on this Earth should be forced to battle with existential problems, just to find comfort and meaning in a life spanning the sunset of our last golden age.

How our collective mindset change will change as we are forced to reckon with this devestation?

Perhaps we will take solace in each other, confronting our common demise with pride and dignity.

Maybe some cataclysmic awakening rip the veil from our eyes and ignite the fury in our hearts. We could to wreak a savage justice upon the liars, pirates, thieves and cold-hearted crooks grown fat on the rape and plunder of the biosphere.
We might live to see skyscrapers crumble and the super-yachts burn,
our monuments to greed annihilate even before we are.

But perhaps more likely: we each beat a lonely retreat into a murky tangle of meaningless social connections, our anger skillfully misdirected and monetized via black-box algorithms, our communities fragmenting and re-precipitating around mindless conspiracy theories.

Time will tell.
