## How to imitate BoJo's success WITHOUT THE RACISM

Optimism is key - same as Trump.

If Optimism is a bright view of the future, then is the converse Grievance: a dark fixation on the past?

Trump sure exhibited a real sense of grievance.

The undenyably amiable Boris - not so much.

Another thing you can say of both men: they treat politics like the game that it surely is.

The only reason to play a game is to win.

Something to clarify - we care about racist action a lot more than racist opinion - it does a lot more damage.

Right off the bat, both BoJo and Trump killed a disproportionatly large number of non-white people via (pre-existing) structural inequality & poor handling of the pandemic.

Both men have also enabled the ongoing white-supremecist violence by the police against people of colour, migrants and asylum seekers.

Although the UK has imprisoned more of it's black population (per capita) than the US, the police violence is unquestionably far more deadly in the US than the UK.

## Key points

* People need to feel part of a greater whole.
* In the past this larger whole took the form of religion, nationalism & communism
* Each has a long history of incredible violence
* Religion has largely declined among (younger people) in Europe & the US
* Nationalism has caused the greatest loss-of-life in human history and continues to be the weapon of ruthless bigots the world over
* Communism is completely out-of-date: the coal-based energy economy of the 19th and 20th centuries is radically different to our computerised mixed-fossil-fuel use
* Maybe what we need is an alternative to nationalism.
* Alt-Nationalism, if you will.
* The goals of Alt-Nationalism are:
  - to reclaim the 'Alt' from the Alt-Right.
  - to provide a 'safe space' where radical left-wingers and patriotic centrists alike can build solidarity upon a shared ownership of culture, language and history.

## To be discussed?

* Boris is not 'Britain Trump' - he did *limited* good on the racism front: citizenship to Hong Kong refugees, created a genuinely diverse cabinet
* What is our alternative to nationalism: how to unite a nation without repeating the failures and injustices of the past?
* What questions would I ask Boris to learn from his success?
* Where do we agree? Where do we disagree? Why?
