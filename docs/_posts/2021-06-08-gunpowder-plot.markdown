need an opinion from you guys - how does the following work as a science-fiction plotline?

### notes

* if any kind of 'magical technological advance' is needed by the plot just invent a result via advancing AI
* this is quite a rough draft - a lot of the final detail to still work out

#### assumptions

I know it sucks, but sorry, please - just imagine that there was no possible vaccine for Covid 19.

* trapped indoors and socially isolated many people become heavily invested in virtual reality (VR) tech
  - becomes cheaper more widely available & more actively developed (for)
  - takes over as the dominant medium of for social interaction

* government corporate & religious actors scramble to exploit this emerging ability as propaganda and as a weapon:
  - isis hackers perform mock executions over the internet on israeli soldiers during simulated training
  - AIs begin to create deep-fake people for use in widely consunmed virtual pornography 
  - ...
  - other morally-grey 'dark dark dark' as necessary to flesh-out and get people's appetites going for violence

* AI-enabled advances in medecine explore the use of VR as a therapy for trauma victims
 - machines are developed which allow for effective computerised reprogramming-by-computer of patients by doctors
 - developed in high-tech research labs & produced in the name of the public, under a deep veil of secrecy
 - basically analagous the the 'the wuhan institute of virology developed covid' explanation for the current plague

* this software ends up 'in the wild' - publicly available in code repositories like  GitHub
 - quickly ends up in the hands of tech giants & terror cells, coders & anarchists, parents, wives & husbands

* shortly afterwards, an anonymous writer publishes a 'VR novella' named GUNPOWDER on Amazon 
 - consumers discover that each single experience of the novel is uniquely individual to them
 - as fans remain unable to discover any pattern through repeated 'readings', some become fanatically obsessed
 - a cult of weirdos, misfits and maladaptives all around the world form a cult based on 'solving the plot'
 - that is - they believe there's some dark conspiracy underfoot which can only be resolved by 'following the clues'

Baby, you got yourself a cult going! Basically not too far away from the Q-anon or the Querdenker movements.
What happens when certain obsessives 'binge-read' the VR-novella - are they being reprogrammed? If so, why?
Is the content from the VR experience generated by inscrutible algorithms? Or could it be the work of a prophet,
some strange and holy window into another world somewhere beyond this one?

Anyway, that's the essential backstory, hope none of it is too farfetched apart from obviously the vaccine thing.
