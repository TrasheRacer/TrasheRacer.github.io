need an opinion from you guys - how does the following work as a science-fiction plotline?

## notes

* if any kind of 'magical technological advance' is needed by the plot just invent a result via advancing AI
* this is quite a rough draft - a lot of the final detail to still work out

## assumptions

I know it sucks, but sorry, please - just imagine that there was no possible vaccine for Covid 19.

#### trapped indoors and socially isolated many people become heavily invested in virtual reality (VR) tech
- becomes, cheaper more widely available & more actively developed (for)
- VR takes over as the dominant medium of for social interaction

#### government corporate & religious actors scramble to exploit this emerging ability, as propaganda and as a weapon:
- isis hackers perform mock executions over the internet on israeli soldiers during simulated training
- AIs begin to create deep-fake people for use in widely consunmed virtual pornography 
- ...
- add enough 'dark dark dark' content as necessary, to engage the reader's appetite for violence

#### AI-enabled advances in medecine explore the use of VR as a therapy for trauma victims
- machines are developed which allow for effective computerised reprogramming-by-computer of patients by doctors
- developed in high-tech research labs & produced in the name of the public, under a deep veil of secrecy
- basically, a lazy analogy the the 'the wuhan institute of virology developed covid' plague-explanation

#### somehow, through malice or idiocy, this reprogramming-software ends up 'in the wild'
- publicly available in code repositories like  GitHub
- quickly ends up in the hands of tech giants & terror cells, coders & anarchists, parents, wives & husbands

#### shortly afterwards, an anonymous writer publishes a 'VR novella' named GUNPOWDER on Amazon 
- consumers discover that each single experience of the novel is uniquely individual to them
- as fans remain unable to discover any pattern through repeated 'readings', some become fanatically obsessed
- a cult of weirdos, misfits and maladaptives all around the world form a cult based on 'solving the plot'
- that is - they believe there's some dark conspiracy underfoot which can only be resolved by 'following the clues'

Baby, you got yourself a cult going! Basically not too far away from the Q-anon or the Querdenker movements.
What happens when certain obsessives 'binge-read' the VR-novella - are they being reprogrammed? If so, why?
Is the content from the VR experience generated by inscrutible algorithms? Or could it be the work of a prophet,
some strange and holy window into another world somewhere beyond this one?
I feel like there's interesting possibilities to explore. It's a nice though experiment:
what would the world be like if there were software to effortlessly program somebody?
Basically, the question is:
How to program a person?

Anyway, that's the essential backstory, hope none of it is too farfetched apart from obviously the vaccine thing.
