Another wet and stormy week on the cards. At least I had a good weekend.

### History repeats

Me & the missus are fans of [the shagged married annoyed podcast](https://www.shaggedmarriedannoyed.com/podcast) (thanks to Jess for reccomendation).
We are midway through the backlog of old episodes and just hit March 2020.
I had an eye kept on the date of each episode so I knew what to expect, and I felt a little bit of dread in my stomach waiting for the first mention of Covid.
It's like we've popped open a year-and-a-bit old time capsule of thoughts, feelings and fears from early pandemic. 
It's funny and a little sad to hear the naïveté and misplaced optimism of "just a couple of weeks lockdown and this will all be over".
