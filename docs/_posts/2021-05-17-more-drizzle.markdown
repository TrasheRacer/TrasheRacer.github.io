Another wet and stormy week on the cards.

### History repeats

Me & the missus are fans of the [Shagged Married Annoyed](https://www.shaggedmarriedannoyed.com/podcast) podcast.

We are midway through the backlog of old episodes and just hit March 2020.
I had an eye on the date of each episode so I knew what to expect, and I felt a little bit of dread in my stomach waiting for the first mention of COVID.

It's like we've popped open a year-and-a-bit old time capsule of thoughts, feelings and fears from early pandemic.
It's funny and a little sad to hear the naïveté and misplaced optimism of "just a couple of weeks lockdown and this will all be over".
