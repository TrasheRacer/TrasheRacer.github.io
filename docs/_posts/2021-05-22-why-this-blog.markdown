Please allow me a moment's reflection on what this blog is for.

I first flirted with the idea of blogging a couple of years ago when I first began learning German,
as a means to improve my foreign language writing skills.
This turned out to be far too difficult and so didn't happen,
although it's something I'll try further down the line as practice for my B2-level exam.
Until then I'll be using this space work on my (Enlish language) communication skills by regularly about a range of topics.

The writers who have had the greatest influence over me include Peter Watts, Anne Frank and Eliza Clark. 
Each of these individuals had the courage to cast the deepest creations of their hearts out into this harsh world.
In our times of great crisis our only resources are our imagination and eachother.
I hope that the ideas I intend to outline may be a source of both hope and unity through this endless pandemic.

I endeavor to produce content which is:
* about as (lightly) entertaining as the average tweet
* well-communicated, especially in terms of clarity on techical or abstract points
* to other software engineers: let this blog be a provocation to re-examine the base axioms of our discipline in view of our dark and uncertain future

Thank you.
