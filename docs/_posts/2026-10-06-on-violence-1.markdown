_[ Write like somebody who thinks the Nazis were terrible, especially because they fucking lost. ]_

**This POST is a reminder to myself to explore and expand my thinking around violence, specifically political violence through the lens of the Climate Crisis, the Covid Pandemic and Everything that Followed, a macro-shot attempt to keep the 4-th Dimension (Time) in mind when condiering the moral calculus of our actions - where the 'our' here is the (constructed) framework of a rational, moral, empiricist agent, seemingly inconsequential within the unfathomabley complex world we inhabit, and fearful of the the dark future creeping in from the black horizon.**     

_[ I guess this thing's gonna be WIP for a couple months? ]_

Inspired my Clausewitz, I'll try to understand what what violence is and how it should be used to achieve political aims. I'll look at examples both past and present, in order to create a program of political violence (implied, theatened and/or actual) for today's concerned citizen.  

_[ TODO: Keep going here to introduce this conception that you're going to try and tease out into (one day) a couple-hundred pages, to be sold on toilet-paper printed books for sale (at bulk rates) to the penny-pinching prepper, the savvy survivalist, and even just the guy who wants to stockpile each of the major (quilted) commodities of civilisation, the bum-wiping and the mind-expanding, combined into one convenient product for the next Cholera Lockdown Or Rolling Blackout!]_

### Who is Clausewhatsit?

One of Clausewitz's best-known quotes summarizes that idea: 'War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.' When he means here by 'War' is precicely it's _ideal_ form - not in the sense that war is an ideal state of affairs, but that in it's 'true' form it functions as an extension of the will of the state _and no further._ This last bit's kind of important, because only the maddest fascists believe war to have inherant worth. 

Clausewitz was a guy who saw a lot of conflict in his time, having kicked the bucket around 1830 after risen through the ranks of the Armies of Europe, witnessing both the rise and fall of the Napoleonic wars. He witnessed a time of unimaginable, unimaginably primitive and personal destruction at a time when the wondners of modern aseptic surgery with narcotics and antibiotics did not exist, an amputation with a doctor who didn't think hand washing made any sense - a preferable alternative to the excruciating creep of gangrene. Basically, a guy who had seen some shit. A guy who knew what human beings do to each other in the pursuit of power and in the pursuit of survival.

_[ **KEY IDEAS:** Conflict. The effect of technology on human life and warfare over time. How to succeed. People remain biologically and neurologically the same as people did in the 1830s and earlier, while the very nature of social and economic relationships has changed drastically over time. Limited use of violence. Knowledge and the unknown. The consequences of error. Violence. Phsical violence. Popular violence. Organised violence. Disorganised violence. Disorganised slaughter. Organised slaughter. Alliances. Industry. Colonialism and globalism. Reacting decisively, instead of planning too far ahead. Germans. How much I love my (chosen, rather than born-into) Fatherland, Germany. The cost of losing.]_

#### What's a state?

_[A monopoly on legit use of violence.]_

#### Where does war fit into political violence more broadly?

#### Why do I care about any of this?

Economics likes to imagine _Homo Economicus,_ that perfectly rational abstraction of an economic agent. An equally unrealistic but more helpful abstraction is to try and conceive of a morally perfect human being. I have no clue what the Latin is for a human with a brain hard-wired for utilitarian maximisation, but that's the idea here, so just as a thought experiment let's question this concept.  

How would such a moral perfectionist relate to political violence?

Normal humans (that is, excluding Nazis) fall into 1 of the 2 following categories:
* violence is _never_ the answer, i.e. absolute pacificsm, often justified as a strategic choice
* violence can be justified depending upon the circumstances, or as Machiavelli put it 'the ends justify the means'

Environmental groups like XR fall into the first category, eschewing all forms of personal violence as doctrine. They draw inspiration from what must be identified as a selective reading of the history of (nonviolent) activism, ignoring for example that the successes of the peaceful US civil rights movements were secured by armed black organisations, and minimalising when considering Apartheid the impact of armed resistance against the regime.

Everybody else comes under the second category: individuals on the left/right/centre of the political spectrum, nations and corporations are all unified in our appreciation of the occassional uses of violence.  

If we allow that violence _might_ sometimes be justified, we then need to ask: is it ever obligatory? This is of course the clasic trolley problem, when killing 1 person causes you to save 5 others. But in a globalised fossil-fuel based economy, how is our imaginary utilitarian to make it even through everyday life, even when not molested by philophers with antique vehicles? When watching a year's worth of netflix burns x grams of carbon and the world becomes that _tiny_ bit warmer and worse? When buying a T-shirt sourced from a grimmer part of the world makes you complicit in a relentless genocide?  

If inaction (defined as apolitical, basic subsistence in an industrialised society) can lead to such undeniable harm, then our utilitarian is left with a hard calculus problem.  
Does the unstoppable structural violence of the moment outweigh the expected violence of the revolution,
clearly neccessary to destroy a devastating status quo?  
Perhaps that's not a question we can answer, but we still have to make a decision on how to act.  

Let's find out, shall we?

### Modern political violence: purpose, goal and means

Clausewitz wrote in the decades following the Napoleonic Wars.   
The political violence of today (of which War forms but a fraction) shows both similarities and diferences.   
Let's start by examining examples of 20th Century political violence.  

#### 2014 Uyghur genocide in China

**Purposes:** centralise power into the head of state, succeed at geopolitics, foster a cult of personality/nationalism

**Goals:** subdue an unruly outgroup, enforce cultural homogeneity, make money via forced labour

#### 2014 Annexation of Crimea by Russia

#### 2021 Kabul airport suicide bombing

All of the above events had a forceful impact upon global politics, yet none fit clean inside Clausewitz's idea of War.  

_**and so on and so forth...**_
