This is a reminder to myself to explore and expand my thinking around violence, specifically political violence.  
Inspired my Clausewitz, I'll try to understand what what violence is and how it should be used to achieve political aims.  
I'll look at examples both past and present in order to create a program of political violence (whether implied, theatened or actual) for the modern activist.  

To be continued...
