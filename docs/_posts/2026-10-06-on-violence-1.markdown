## Introduction: on violence, from the abstract to the all too concrete

_[Written like someone who thinks the Nazis were terrible, especially because they fucking lost.]_

**This post is a (first in a series of?) dialogs between myself and myself, a means to explore and wax philosophical about violence, specifically political violence through the lens of the great recession, climate crisis, the first Covid pandemic, and all that followed.**     

Violence is part of the natural world, no, part of the very fabric of the universe itself, from one amoeba engulfing another to a black hole vampire-like draining the plasma from a star. It's an inescapable part of existence. Let's start with a definition - I'm working out where I'm going here as I write, so let's choose a shotgun rather than a sniper rifle:

> Violence is matter, forced into some configuration against it's will. 

Amoeba and singularities are all very well for seventh-bonghit-4AM-banter, but I need to write something ... more applied. More useful. Something in the region between bong-hit 2 and 3.

_[**PROPOSAL:** consider under the category 'political violence' any kind of violence as long as it is organised, directed and with a political goal (but what does this mean?), taking as a starting pojnt non-violent cyberattacks on property causing some kind of socio-economic disruption, up to large scale 'just collateral casualties' industrial attacks like pipeline sabotage via drone, and escalating from there in response to the importance & urgency of the (appropriate) political goal.]_

> ~~Political violence is violence plus purpose, by people.~~

No, this isn't quite right - a mugger punching you in the face and taking your wallet is done purposefully, but we wouldn't (usually) call it political. Leaving this for now until we flesh out some examples.

_[I guess this thing's gonna be WIP for a couple months?]_

The book Vom Kriege (translation from German: On War) was published posthumously in 1832 by (the wife of) Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz. From the 19th century and into the 21st, war remains the more dramatic, overt form of political violence, but far from the only one. 

I like Clausewitz. Rather than a toothless theorist like so many philosophers, he was a doer. Despite the high-minded enlightenment-vintage style, what he wrote was a user manual, a stack exchange post for the era of cannon and cavalry. But, I hear you ask, what the hell does he have to do with anything? Whatever of utility can you possibly learn from a man writing so far from our present age - written back when a computer was a lowly-paid clerk toiling in an office? When even the most devestating war could destroy only hundreds of thousands of men at worst, rather than millions (or more) of men, women and children consumed by industrialised slaughter? Written in a time even before what we would recognise as modern industry, around a century before the conception of the production line? Before TNT and nuclear bombs and even the police force?

People. People don't change. Evolutionarily, genetically, neurologically, we are identical to our ancestors stretching back tens of thousands of years. In the 1820s or in the 2020s, we have the same drives and motivations and yearning for control - of our environment, of others and of ourselves. There's always another guy under the other flag (or religion or political party) who wants to arrange the universe to suit him rather than you, and he's ready to hurt. To kill. To torture. To oppress. In the name of survival, or god, or economics - the justifications are endless.

Violence, and the fact that there's always someone fully convinced they're on 'the good side' yet ready (even eager) to do it to you, is an ever-present fact of the human condition (or at least that's what evidence would suggest). 

But, on the subject of things that never change and never will (oh the irony), worse problems persist: our delusions of understanding - of the past, the present and the future. Could our General have possibly known that his ideas would in less than a century bear the fruit of the bloodiest conflicts in existence - the second and first world wars? Can you (or I) ever **really** understand another soul who's seen the abject horror of a 19th century battleground? Grapeshot limbs hacked off without anesthesia; an aristocracy emboldened with the lingering privelege of divine right; nationalism an idea so young as to be without stain from genocide, for all the now-primitive savagery still blissfully untouched by the full, existential apocalypse that was 20th century total war. And even today, with our swamps of data, a tsunami of telemetry washing through our networks (for those who can read it) - are we really any closer to understanding our society in a way that lets us shape it for the better of mankind? Or are we just as unaware of our faulty assumptions, ambivalent to the cruel effects of our consumption, trapped by longing for prestige/influence/power just like our ancestors?

One truly adminarble aspect of Clausewitz's intellect was his grasp of the unknown & the unknowable, the hard lessons glimpsed by a determined practitioner through the fog and smoke. The first casualty of any war is the plan, but modern life is far more uncertain than even the wildest 19th-century conflict. From 9/11 to the 2008 crash to the pandemics, we human beings remain so unaware of how utterly _terrible_ we are at predicting the future, clinging to models and forecasts in the face of overwhelming evidence that these toys break down over a timescale of any significance.

We need to remain capable of effective action in spite of this darkness, this fog-of-peace. We need heuristics to guide action, to do effective politics when lost in the unknown. 

We need this post.

## Inspiration: on Clausewitz on War

Clausewitz was a guy who saw a lot of conflict in his time, having kicked the bucket around 1830 after risen through the ranks of the Armies of Europe, witnessing both the rise and fall of the Napoleonic wars. He witnessed a time of unimaginable, unimaginably primitive and personal destruction at a time when the wondners of modern aseptic surgery with narcotics and antibiotics did not exist, an amputation with a doctor who didn't think hand washing made any sense - a preferable alternative to the excruciating creep of gangrene. Basically, a guy who had seen some shit. A guy who knew what human beings do to each other in the pursuit of power and in the pursuit of survival.

One of his best-known quotes summarizes that idea: 'War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.' When he means here by 'War' is precicely it's _ideal_ form - not in the sense that war is an ideal state of affairs, but that in it's 'true' form it functions as an extension of the will of the state _and no further_ - this last bit is important but easily neglected. 

_[**KEY IDEAS:** Conflict. The effect of technology on human life and warfare over time. How to succeed. People remain biologically and neurologically the same as people did in the 1830s and earlier, while the very nature of social and economic relationships has changed drastically over time. Limited use of violence. Knowledge and the unknown. The consequences of error. Violence. Phsical violence. Popular violence. Organised violence. Disorganised violence. Disorganised slaughter. Organised slaughter. Alliances. Industry. Colonialism and globalism. Reacting decisively, instead of planning too far ahead. Germans. How much I love my (chosen, rather than born-into) Fatherland, Germany. The cost of losing. Revolution, history of. Utopianism, kritik of. **And so on and so forth**]_

## Objective: 12 rules for life as an ~~a~~moral utilitarian automata

_[How to kick off a manifesto?]_

Economics likes to imagine [Homo Economicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus), that perfectly rational abstraction of an economic agent. An equally unrealistic but more helpful abstraction is to try and conceive of a morally perfect human being. I have no clue what the Latin is for a human with a brain hard-wired for utilitarian maximisation, but that's the idea here, so just as a thought experiment let's question this concept.  

How would such a moral perfectionist relate to political violence?

Normal humans (that is, excluding Nazis) fall into 1 of the 2 following categories:
* violence is _never_ the answer, i.e. absolute pacificsm, often justified as a strategic choice
* violence can be justified depending upon the circumstances, or as Machiavelli put it 'the ends justify the means'

Environmental groups like XR fall into the first category, eschewing all forms of personal violence as doctrine. They draw inspiration from what must be identified as a selective reading of the history of (nonviolent) activism, ignoring for example that the successes of the peaceful US civil rights movements were secured by armed black organisations, and minimalising when considering Apartheid the impact of armed resistance against the regime.

Everybody else comes under the second category: individuals on the left/right/centre of the political spectrum, nations and corporations are all unified in our appreciation of the occassional uses of violence.  

If we allow that violence _might_ sometimes be justified, we then need to ask: is it ever obligatory? This is of course the clasic trolley problem, when killing 1 person causes you to save 5 others. But in a globalised fossil-fuel based economy, how is our imaginary utilitarian to make it even through everyday life, even when not molested by philophers with antique vehicles? When watching a year's worth of netflix burns x grams of carbon and the world becomes that _tiny_ bit warmer and worse? When buying a T-shirt sourced from a grimmer part of the world makes you complicit in a relentless genocide?  

If inaction (defined as apolitical, basic subsistence in an industrialised society) can lead to such undeniable harm, then our utilitarian is left with a hard calculus problem. Does the unstoppable structural violence of the moment outweigh the expected violence of the revolution, clearly neccessary to destroy a devastating status quo? Perhaps that's not a question we can answer, but we still have to make a decision on how to act.  

## Motivation: case studies of political violence in today's era

Clausewitz wrote in the decades following the Napoleonic Wars. The political violence of today (of which War forms but a fraction) shows both similarities and diferences. Let's examine a diverse selection of examples of 20th Century political violence.  

_[**TODO:** Expand these sections. Contrast with Clausewitz's conception of war. Connect to political violence more broadly.]_

### Ongoing genocide against the Uyghur genocide in People's Republic of China

### Successful annexation of the Crimean Penisula by Russia Federation

### Failed occupation of Afganistan by the United States & the United Kingdom

### Extrajudicial imprisonment, torture & murder by law enforcement personnel within Europe

All of the above events had a forceful impact upon global politics, yet none fit cleanly inside Clausewitz's idea of War.  

_[**To consider:** why these examples? which others to consider? each of these is sufficient hot content for a post of it's own - but first, establish a framework for analysis.]_
