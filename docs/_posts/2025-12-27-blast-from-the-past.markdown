Came across an old backup USB stick at the back of my desk drawer and took a poke around inside.  
From way way back in the day before VR took over the world (and more specifically my life),  
but not before the first pandemic had done a serious job of fucking ruining everything.

The long forgotten years come crashing back in an instant to wipe the present clean off the slate in a wash of well-intentioned naivete and the plucky spirit of an ignorant soul.
Hope, clearly visible in the bare skeleton of the medium to say nothing of the messaging; an act of defiance against the crushing determinism of an unfair world slowly cooking the trapped billions as the trillionaires skip around the solar system.
I prod around the files, the projects and plans, the schemes and schemas and dreams we built to try and make the world even just a little tiny bit less terrible.

Things did not turn out the way we expected (not a topic for today).

It's hard now for me to look at what I once helped create. 
So much of the self flayed naked and pinned exposed to a cork board for all to see - if you know how to look.
I see a frightened child in a ugly man's body, over-educated and under-adapted to this strange new world.
Only with the panic of a drowning swimmer could such an 'intelligent' creature know the futility of a goal and yet accelerate full-throttle toward it; anything to distract from the stinking blackness within.
To feel such abject distain, even outright cringing disgust toward my own pushy, obnoxious and (as time always tells) ultimately delusional courage with which I became a warrior fighting that good and futile fight for justice.
