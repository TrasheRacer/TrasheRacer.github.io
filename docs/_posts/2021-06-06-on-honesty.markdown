title: "On Honesty"

I was taught as a child that honesty is always the best policy - something golden, of intrinsic value,
like a theorem in pure mathematics, beautiful and worthy in it's own right.
I really put this into practice, at least when it came to my relationships with other people
(not so much regarding my relationship with myself, but I'm working on that).
Defaulting to honesty has worked out pretty well for me as a strategy for social bonding; my ability to convincingly lie
is seriously hampered by simple lack of experience. I wear my heart on my sleeve - where else could I wear it?
As a corollary: because I'm effectively unable to conceal my own inability to mislead anyone,
I tend to come across as a fundamentally open and trustworthy individual.
People open up to me because I myself an open book.
I count myself lucky for the many deep and genuine relationships based on this dynamic,
each one a spark of joy making my life truly worth living.

All the same, I've been re-appraising this idea from a more pragmatic standpoint.
Within interpersonal relationships, trust might certainly be **gold**
but perhaps honesty is much more like **currency** - certainly valuable, but only in an extrinsic sense,
based on it's utility as a medium of exchange. Let me try to explain.

We all have needs just like any other animal. Broadly speaking these can be broken down
into three categories.

Our physical needs include oxygen, water, chemical energy and sleep.
You miss out on one of these, you're gonna have a bad time very soon.
The continuous satisfaction of these needs forms the basis of our economy,
and this thing we call 'civilization' is essentially any form of society
in which the majority of people have most of their physical needs safely met, most of the time.
I'd like to argue for including electrical power supply & internet access among these physical needs,
but that can wait for another day.

Social needs are undoubtedly as important as physical needs, if somewhat less urgent.
without family, friends or loved ones, not one of us could make it through life without crippling emotional agony.
We aren't just social animals - we are _the most_ social animals. We sit here at the top of the food chain
not on the basis of our physical strength or stamina, but because our culture evolves orders of magnitude faster
than our genes do via evolution. Even though economists pretend we're all rational agents, biology tells us something quite different:
our brains are high-performance meat computers optimized solely for tribal survival.
Our ways of seeing the world, our very consciousness,is inextricably linked to the wider society surrounding us.
We stop needing other people only when we stop _being_ people.

Due to the overlap between our modes of thought and our social structures, the dividing line between our
social needs and our intellectual needs is blurry.
Morality, creativity, problem-solving - why do we even have these capabilities, if not to better navigate the group structures ensnaring us?
However, one key difference between social and intellectual needs exists: some people seem able to lead fulfilling lives
even when one or more intellectual these needs goes totally unfulfilled.
To pick a lazy example, take Donald J(enius) Trump - a man devoid of an ounce of moral fibre,
incapable even of stringing a coherent sentence together, to say nothing of critical thinking or abstract thought.
Still, he was (temporarily at least) _a success_ when it came to politics, the only real game of any importance,
even where people far smarter than him had failed. The Trump presidency should teach us one crucial lesson:
logic, facts, truth and rationality become utterly irrelevant to winning hearts and minds,
when instead one wields gut-level emotional connection like a weapon, resonating with and amplifying powerful emotions like fear and anger.

How does honesty function when viewed as a social technology in this context?

The fulfillment of our physical, social and intellectual needs boils down to two interconnected goals.
We each seek to understand ourselves, our social groups and the world around us.
We also attempt to _change_ these things, re-shaping the universe to better meet to our desires.

**activate asshole mode**

Unless you happen to be born as royalty or otherwise land on your ass into a paddling pool of wealth/power,
your only hope of really shaping your lived experience to your will is dependent upon your ability to influence other people.

You want that well paid job? Better smash the interview.
Need someone to stick around and provide you with companionship, sex and self-esteem? That first date really has to go well!
Looking for a mortgage? Gotta shown the bank employee that you check all their boxes for a good investment.

In the game-theory sense, honesty only pays off as a strategy when you're facing an honest 'opponent' - taking that word loosely
to refer to anyone you're doing a social interaction with, where you care more about your best interests than theirs.
If the person you're talking to is lying but not you - why the hell not!? What are you holding the moral high ground for, just enjoying the view?
Things get much more interesting when we consider what happens when you only associate with honest individuals.

In the reverse of the above scenario, if you are dishonest towards an honest person then you get an advantage
in whatever 'game' you happen to be playing. The crucial thing of course is not to get caught lying.
What's the best way to do this? There are two key factors:

- experience lying
- honest reputation

Like any skill, ability to convincingly lie is something which is developed through hard practice.
On the other hand, a reputation for honesty is developed through _either_ practice being honest _or_ practice successfully lying.
Honesty alone does not develop your ability to play the game.

**out of steam, fuck**

### TODO

Finish off this essay:

- make a case for 'honesty as a policy' only as a means to an end, i.e. understanding & reshaping existance
- honesty is most effective _in combination with_ 'tactical dishonesty' i.e. telling lies _only_ when it's useful
- basically - does it pay off to be just a little bit evil?
