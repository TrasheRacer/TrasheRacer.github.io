title:  "On Honesty"

I was taught as a child that honesty is always the best policy - something golden, of intrinsic value,
like a theorem in pure mathematics, beautiful and worthy in it's own right. 
I really put this into practice, at least when it came to my relationships with other people
(not so much regarding my relationship with myself, but I'm working on that).
Defaulting to honesty has worked out pretty well for me as a strategy for social bonding; my ability to convincingly lie
is severly hampered by simple lack of experience. I wear my heart on my sleeve - where else can I put it?
As a corollary: because I'm effectively unable to conceal my own inability to mislead anyone,
I tend to come across as a fundamentally open and trustworthy individual.
People open up to me because I myself an open book.
I count myself lucky for the many deep and genuine relationships based on this dynamic,
each one a spark of joy making my life truly worth living.

All the same, I've been re-appraising this idea from a more pragmatic standpoint.
Within interpersonal relationships, trust might certainly be **gold**
but perhaps honesty is much more like **currency** - certainly valuable, but only in an extrinsic sense,
based on it's utility as a medium of exchange. Let me try to explain.

We all have needs just like any other animal. Broadly speaking these can be broken down
into 3 fairly distinct  categories. 

Our physical needs include oxygen, water, chemical energy and sleep.
You miss out on one of these then you're gonna have a bad time very soon. 
The continuous satisfaction of these needs forms the very basis of our economy,
and the thing we call civilisation is essentially any form of human society
where most people have most of their physical needs safely met, most of the time.
I'd like to argue for including electrical power supply & internet access among these needs,
but that reasoning can wait for another post.

Social needs are undoubtedly as important as physical needs, if somewhat less urgent.
without family, friends or loved ones, not one of us could make it through life without crippling emotional agony.
We aren't just social animals - we are *the most* social animals. We sit here at the top of the food chain
not on the basis of our physical strength or stamina, but because our culture evolves orders of magnitude faster
than the process of evolution. Even as economists pretend we're all rational agents, our brains are high-performance
meat computers designed for tribal survival. Our ways of seeing the world, our very conciousness, 
is inextricably linked to the wider society surrounding us. 
We stop needing other people only when we stop *being* people.

Due to the overlap between our modes of thought and our social structures, the dividing line between our
social needs and our intellectual needs is blurry. 
Morality, creativity, problem-solving - why have we even developed these abilities, if not to 
more successfully navigate the group structures we are enmeshed within?
There is however one key difference between social and intellectual needs: many people seem able to lead fulfilling lives,
even when one or more of these needs goes unfulfilled.
To pick a lazy example, take Donald J(enius) Trump, a man devoid of an ounce of moral fibre,
incapable even of stringing a coherent sentace together, to say nothing of critical thinking or abstract thought.
Still, he was for a limited time and by objective reckoning a success, succeeding at a political power game
where much smarter people had failed. There is perhaps one importan lesson we can learn from the Trump presidency:
logic, facts, truth and rationality become utterly irrelevant to political discourse,
when instead one can rely on a gut-level emotional connection to resonate with and amplify the feelings of others.

How does honesty function when viewed as a social technology in this context?

The fulfilment of our physical, social and intellectual needs boils down to two connected goals.
We seek to understand ourselves, our social groups and the world around us.
We also attempt to *change* each of these things, re-shaping the universe to better meet to our desires.

### TODO

Finish off this essay:
* make a case for 'honesty as a policy' only as a means to an end, i.e. understanding & reshaping existance
* honesty is most effective *in combination with* 'tactical dishonesty' i.e. telling lies *only* when it's useful
* basically - does it pay off to be just a little bit evil?
