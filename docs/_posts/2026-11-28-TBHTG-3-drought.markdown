## Work in progress

I've never (yet) lived through a severe drought, but to some extent we are all familiar with the extended consequences.

/** Something here about conflict in the Med/North Africa and knock-on effects to European Authoritarianism */

Due to the increasingly destructive consequences of climate change,
it is increasingly likely that we as global citizens will bear the negative effects extreme heat,
water shortages, and the social & political consequences that come along with this.

What can we learn from how people have historically dealt with this environmental problem on a social level?
And how can this inevitable disruption & disaster be used as an oppourtunity to take down The Blob?
