Hello internet. This is my blog.

I'm a British guy living in Amsterdam with my wife and a couple of cats.
I work as a software engineer in the field of space operations for a Munich-based firm.
I'm also building a side project, involving data collection on structural racism & abuse of police power (more on that later).

I toyed with blogging a couple of years ago when I first began learning German, as a means to improve my foreign language writing skills.

This turned out to be far too difficult.

I've staked out my claim to this little bit of the web, creating a little space at the boundary of public/private life, where I can safely explore my inner thoughts.
To that end I've blacklisted a couple of IP addresses belonging to friends and loved ones.
I need the space to breathe, to feel and think as I truly am, without judgement.
