Hello internet. This is my blog.

I'm a British guy living in Amsterdam with my beautiful wife and a couple of cats.
I work as a software engineer in the field of space operations for a Munich-based firm.
I'm also building a side project, involving data collection on structural racism & abuse of police power (more on that later).

I toyed with blogging a couple of years ago when I first began learning German, as a means to improve my foreign language writing skills.

This turned out to be far too difficult.

I've staked out my claim to this little bit of the web as a space to grow and explore my thoughts on topics I care about.

The writers who have had the greatest influence over me include Peter Watts, Anne Frank and Eliza Clark.
These people had the courage to cast the deepest creations of their hearts out into this harsh world.
In our times of great crisis our only resources are our imagination and each other.
