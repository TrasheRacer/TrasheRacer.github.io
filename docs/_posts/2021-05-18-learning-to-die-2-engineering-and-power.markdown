The third chapter of Learning to Die leads with a definition of politics both useful and pleasingly abstract.
Like other social animals, humans structure societies around the production of energy through the application of labour to natural resources.
In comparison to honeybees, which can only meet their energy needs throught collection and processing of pollen,
our energy production has undergone three revolutions in our 200,000-odd year history:
 * the agricultural revolution: deliberate & organised cultivation of biomass via photosynthesis
 * the industrial revolution: switch from renewable energy sources to coal
 * the great acceleration: widespread use of mixed fossil fuels alongside develoment of nuclear technology

This analysis offers a compelling explanation for the rise of early political technologies like despotism and empire,
as a means of organising the mass of labour required to sustain flood-based irrigation in the arid climate of the 'fertile crescent' of the ancient middle east.
It also explains the rise of both industrial capitalism *and* mass democracy in the 19th and 20th centuries primarily as a consequence of coal-based energy production:
unionisation and strikes offered workers significant leverage through disruption of the carbon-based energy flow critical to economic success.
In our current age of mixed fossil fuel use, oil and natural gas move around the world via pipelines and tankers dependent upon small crews of highly-skilled technicians.
The working classes of the world no longer have the same bargining power within the energy economy.

### Why does engineering matter?

> The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".

Engineering is the discipline of creating, reproducing and changing  the structures of political power.
Before the modern era engineering was limited to construction of military engines of war, like those used in medieval seiges.
Since the explosion of technological innovation this field has broadened, it's link to the mechanisms of power becoming deeper yet more obscure.
What is the construction of a skyscraper if not a statement of the cultural and social might of the owner (and their worldview)?
If politics is the movement of energetic bodies in a system then it stands that creating a bridge, a highway, a pipeline is an expression of political will.
As software engineering becomes ever more critical to the basic infrastructure of the world,
it seems like a good time to step back and examine the moral and ethical foundations of our field with a critical eye.

Today we may talk about civil engineering, mechanical engineering or software engineering in the same breath as natural sciences or pure mathematics.
It is convenient to pretend that we engage in a nonidealogical discipline, apolitical and benign, free of social responsibility and subject only to the laws of the market.
We would do well to remember that just like all other engineers, from the builders of canals in ancient mesopotamia to designers of coal mines and railways in 19th-century England,
and from women like Ada Lovelace at the foundation of computer science to today's programmers all connected as endnodes of a vast world-spanning network,
we wield the collective power to reshape not just the physical universe but the very bonds of human civilisation. 

We just need to wake up and realise it.
