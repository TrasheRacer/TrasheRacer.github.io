## Work in progress

The next **worst** financial crash is, as always, _unimaginably_ more terrible than the one that came before.

Maybe it's hyperinflation, this time with wheelbarrows of cash replaced by debit cards running frantically dry.
Or a hack at Visa, at Mastercard, some ransomeware bringing systems crashing down.
Even a power cut, data centres running out of diesel to power their generators.
And in your lifetime.

What can we do to bring down The Blob under this eventually?
