# Paleo Software Engineering, or: adapting to the Climate Reality at in Space Operations

## Abstract

### Climate change is a hard collective action problem with no easy technological fix.

It is a serious, urgent & long-term problem:
  - global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C by 2052 at present rates
  - the risks to social, economic & national security are catestrophic
 
Other large organisations are already aware & adapting: for example, the US Government & Armed Forces

Attempts at technological fixes have been hampered by socio-economic forces:
  - for example, Carbon cap-and-trade - it's hard to fix a price on carbon
  - thought experiment: 100% renewable power tomorrow => everything collapses
 
### A solution, if one exists, must be a transition to a decarbonized economy.
  
This will require both technological and socio-political adaption because all purely technological approaches to fixing climate change have failed.

Thought experiment (& unproven solution): Sequestered Carbon Standard (SCS)
  - Analagous to the move during the 20th century away from the gold standard & onto fiat money.
  - Fix the price of the Euro to the an index measuring sequestered carbon.
  - How does the economy change? Does it stay the same, but with new incentives?

Either way, hard numbers on carbon exchange suddenly become important...
    
### As engineers dedicated to the future success of our organisation and eachother, we need to start adapting to our new reality.

We can start to tackle any problem simply by actually measuring it's scale:
  - introduce a metric => https://miro.medium.com/max/414/1*3ACO7Uqced5vcJHBhJVDCw.png (look & feel)
  - makes it harder to avoid confronting a difficult & largely-hidden problem => it becomes less intractible

We should design, develop and deploy a small set of Carbon Exchange Estimation (CBE) widgets in Space-Ops control rooms for all projects.

Create two key widgets display a rough estimation of the following: 
  - grams of carbon released/sequestered on a per-project basis
  - global cummulative carbon emissions since 1900

Each widget to display current value, trend with appropriate time-series

### Becoming intimate with the scope & scale of our predicament is sure to be the first, best step along the light path of our species' future.
  
Displaying the long-term costs of our ongoing operations forces our highly-skilled and determined workforce to deal with the problem.
Could there be a better way to stimulate progress on a deeply challenging and existentially threatening problem?
Nobody is coming to save us but us.
  
### Doing so will allow us to harness our collective awareness into building the future: the discipline of Decarbonised (Software) Engineering.
