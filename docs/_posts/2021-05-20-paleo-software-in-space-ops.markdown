## Abstract

### Climate change is a hard collective action problem with no easy technological fix

It is a serious, urgent & long-term problem:

- global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C by 2052 at present rates
- the risks to social, economic & national security are catastrophic

Other large organizations are already aware of and adapting to the problem: for example, US government, armed forces

Attempts at technological fixes have been hampered by socio-economic forces;
for example, carbon cap-and-trade policy:

- carbon pricing based on probabilistic assessment of economic costs
- made difficult by undertain predictions & complex effects

### A solution, if one exists, must be a transition to a decarbonized economy

This will require both technological and socio-political adaption because all purely technological approaches to fixing climate change have failed.

Thought experiment: monetary system based on a sequestered-carbon standard

- Analagous to the move during the 20th century away from the gold standard & onto fiat money.
- Fix the price of the Euro to the an index measuring sequestered carbon.
- How does the economy change?
  - What stays same, but with new incentives around carbon emission?

Whatever the solution looks like, actual numbers on carbon emissions/exchange suddenly become important for large organizations.

### We need to start adapting to our new reality

We can start to tackle any problem simply by actually measuring it's scale:

- introduce a metric to measure the problem _and_ progress toward solution
- makes it harder to avoid confronting a difficult & largely-hidden problem => it becomes more tractable

Something like this (for the look & feel):

We should design, develop and deploy a small set of widgets to display estimated trends in carbon emission(/exchange), in all space-operations control rooms.

Key widgets include rough estimation of the following:

- grams of carbon released on a per-project basis
- global cumulative carbon emissions since beginning of operations
- global average temperature rise (long-term)

Each widget to display current value, trend with appropriate time-series

### We must become intimate with the scope & scale of our species' predicament

To display the long-term climate cost of ongoing operations would force our highly-skilled and determined workforce to deal with the problem.

Could there be a better way to stimulate progress on a deeply challenging and existentially threatening problem?

Nobody else is coming to save us.
