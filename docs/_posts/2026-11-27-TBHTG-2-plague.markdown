## Work in progress

Consider the next plague.

We don't have to go back long to remember what the _last_ one was like, 
and I'm sure we've all had enough of the rolling lockdowns & psycho-social deprivation.
But - what has happened before **will** happen again.

And next time - we may not get off so lightly.

We have the benefit of hindsight.
How do we leverage a pandemic into exposing & destroying The Blob?
