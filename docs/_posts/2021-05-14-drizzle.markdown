Up at 7.

Two cups of tea.
Stayed in bed too long listening to news radio.
Weather grim: grey clouds every direction.
Chilly rain. Dark weekend.

All my weekly hours done (incl. bank hols) but got fuck-all to show for it.
UX changes needed still unfinished.
Paralytic. Useless like a spastic appendix.

Still.
I'll do my German vocab - flashcards.
Better start to turn this day around.
This vestigial organ wants to be great one day.

Chipping at TODO list.
Baby steps tottering away from standstill.

- Sad: 2/10
- Sleep: enough
- Sober: OK
