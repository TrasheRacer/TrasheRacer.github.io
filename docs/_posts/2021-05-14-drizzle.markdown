Up at 7, 2 cups of tea, stayed in bed too long just listening to radio.
Weather is grim: grey clouds stretch in every direction. Chilly rain. Dark weekend.

After the bank holiday my weekly hours are all done but I got fuck all to show for it.
UX changes needed for project param mutations are still unfinished.
I feel paralytic and useless like a spastic appendix.

Still, I'll get my German vocab memorized, start turning this day around.
At least _this_ vestigial organ wants to make something of itself.
Then start chipping away at the old TODO list.
Baby steps tottering away from a total standstill.

- Sad: 2/10
- Sleep: sufficient
- Sober: reluctantly
