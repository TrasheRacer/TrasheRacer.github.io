Woke up at 7AM, drank 2 cups of tea and stayed in bed until around 10AM listening to BBC radio.  
The weather is grim: grey clouds stretch in every direction. Chilly rain. Little sun forecast this weekend.  

After the bank holiday yesterday my required hours for the week are complete, but I have little to show for it.  
I haven't been able to finish the UX changes in the model tree view which would allow creation of a new parameter via a project patch.  
Paralysed and useless, I am the spastic appendix of mission planning at the ESA.
I'll get my German vocabulary for the day memorised first, to make myself feel good; at least *this* vestigial organ wants to make something of itself.
Afterwards I will work top-to-bottom through my TODO list for the UX changes.
Baby steps to avoid a complete standstil.

* Depression: 2 /10
* Sleep: enough
* Sober: for now
