I finally load the audio file into the data pipeline I've so laboriously coded, the cobbled-together knowledge of internet comments.
My laptop freezes for a moment, apparently shocked by what I'm forcing it into, before the fans whirr loudly into action.
It's running; estimated time to completion: 1 hour, 42 minutes.
This could be so much faster if I ran this on the cloud like everyone else, but unlike so many others I value my privacy.
And anyway - it would be so easy for some ignorant fuck in the wrong government department to mis-understand what I do.
I'm just here to create a product, entertainment, marketable content - whatever you want to call it, it's my god-given right to sling it.
Consumers, on the other hand, have to justify it to themselves somewhat differently.
Some people simply don't think too hard about it, seeing merely true-crime re-enactment with a high-tech twist.
Other customers protect their percieved purity by only partaking of cold cases, fixated on the possibility of solving crime decades old.
As if there is the faintest hope that in some hazy re-creation there could be a 'missing piece of the puzzle':
an errant blood splatter, a footprint, a clue gone un-noticed by actual detectives with training and experience in reality.
Suckers - but their money's still good.

I lean back in my chair and vape. The buzzing laptop and my own breathing are the only sounds within my quiet home.

It's been a while since I touched this blog. Anyone miss me? I guess not - it's been a busy couple of years.

A soft alert tells me the pipeline is complete, and with a soft sigh of relief my laptop cuts off it's fan.
The output directory contains one single massive file, which I load into the holodeck software.
I run automated tests for file corruption, checking that I haven't wound up with a meaningless block of binary static.
Or something worse: one can never really tell what to expect, playing with AI and virtual reality in such haphazard fashion.
Sanity-checking is always advisable, ideally before the computer connection meets the fragile monkey brain.
In this case, the output of the pipeline 'makes sense' - at least, to a computer.
That'll have to be good enough for me. Truth be told, I'm a hesitant, but I strap on the VR gear regardless.
Not so much hesitant about the effect of what I've created on my brain, but anxious about the prospect of failure.
A lot of effort has gone into this, and I need to see a result soon with letters from the bank piling up by the front door.
No previous attempt has yielded anything close to a monetizable product.
Error outputs to be sure, along with unintelligiable blocks of garbage output.
Recent attempts between tweaks to the narrative circuitry have been more promising to be sure.
If there were much of a market for the Avant-garde nightmares of a sadist with Agnosia, then I would already be in the money.
It's hard for a computer to tell a story; much easier to churn out a collage of simulated violence and suffering totally devoid of time or structure.
I take a deep breath and run the file.
