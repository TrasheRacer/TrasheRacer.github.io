I finally load the audio file into the data pipeline I've so laboriously coded, the cobbled-together knowledge of internet comments.  
My laptop freezes for a moment, apparently shocked by what I'm forcing it into, before the fans whirr loudly into action.  
It's running; estimated time to completion: 1 hour, 42 minutes.  
This could be so much faster if I ran this on the cloud like everyone else, but unlike so many others I value my privacy.  
And anyway - it would be so easy for some ignorant fuck in the wrong government department to mis-understand what I do.  
I'm just here to create a product, entertainment, marketable content - whatever you want to call it, it's my god-given right to sling it.  
Consumers, on the other hand, have to justify it to themselves somewhat differently.  
Some people simply don't think too hard about it, seeing merely true-crime re-enactment with a high-tech twist.  
Other customers protect their percieved purity by only partaking of cold cases, fixated on the possibility of solving crime decades old.  
As if there is the faintest hope that in some hazy re-creation there could be a 'missing piece of the puzzle':  
an errant blood splatter, a footprint, a clue gone un-noticed by actual detectives with training and experience in reality.  
Suckers - but their money's still good.  

I lean back in my chair and vape. The buzzing laptop and my own breathing are the only sounds within my quiet home.

It's been a while since I touched this blog. Anyone miss me? I guess not - it's been a busy couple of years.

A soft alert tells me the pipeline is complete, and with a soft sigh of relief my laptop cuts off it's fan.  
The output directory contains one single massive file, which I load into the holodeck software.  
I run automated tests for file corruption, checking that I haven't wound up with a meaningless block of binary static.  
Or something worse: one can never really tell what to expect, playing with AI and virtual reality in such haphazard fashion.  
Sanity-checking is always advisable, ideally before the computer connection meets the fragile monkey brain.  
In this case, the output of the pipeline 'makes sense' - at least, to a computer.  
That'll have to be good enough for me. Truth be told, I'm a hesitant, but I strap on the VR gear regardless.  
Not so much hesitant about the effect of what I've created on my brain, but anxious about the prospect of failure.  
A lot of effort has gone into this, and I need to see a result soon with letters from the bank piling up by the front door.  
No previous attempt has yielded anything close to a monetizable product.  
Error outputs to be sure, along with unintelligiable blocks of garbage output.  
Recent attempts between tweaks to the narrative circuitry have been more promising to be sure.  
If there were much of a market for the Avant-garde nightmares of a sadist with Agnosia, then I would already be in the money.  
It's hard for a computer to tell a story; much easier to churn out a collage of simulated violence and suffering totally devoid of time or structure.  
I take a deep breath and run the file.  

You're approaching a huge American house, not quite a McMansion but close to it, sprawling across the summer afternoon sky.  
Birds swoop through the sky as your black Police-issue boots crunch across the gravel, the sun blazing down upon your forehead.  
The great front door stands in front of you while your colleagues shuffle just out of sight to either side of you, guns sheathed at least for now.  
Your big white hand comes up and hammers - "Police! This is a community welfare check! Open up!"  
Again and again, no response - everything quiet apart from the crackle of walkie-talkies and the busy hum of insect activity.  
You're instructed to breach; a heavy metal battering ram is brought up as you shout a last unheeded warning through the door.  
You swing it back then smash it into the door, wood splintering and metal tearing. It crashes open to leave a cavernous maw into darkness.  
Your pupils strain to adjust, the dark room beyond a pit of blackness lit only by daylight streaming through the hole.  
Dropping the ram and drawing your service pistol, you enter the grand hallway and immediately see a figure slumped at the other end.  
Lieing on the floor next to it are the dark unmistakable outlines of a rifle and a shotgun, pointing toward you.  
In an instant you decide - "Drop the gun! Hands up!" - you rush across the room to the motionless man, kicking the weapons away.  
You and your team-mates have the man surrounded and disarmed, and after checking his vital signs establish that he's alive, barely.  
A syringe containing a last remnant of heroin sticks from his limp arm. You call for an ambulance and he is taken away to hospital under gaurd.  

You search the house; in every room is the perceptible smell of rotting meat, evident even under the overbearing odour of cleaning products.  
Each windowed room with curtains has them drawn; where none exist, black plastic bin-liners have been taped across windows to block all light.  
The dining room floor shows the outline of a rug recently removed from the floorboards, a dark rectangle discolouring the wood beneath.  
In the garage - an enourmous freezer, seemingly a new purchase by the stickers on the side - "XXL - big enough for two bodies!"...
