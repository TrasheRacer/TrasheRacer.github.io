## 0.0 Background

If you're not familiar with the Blob,
check this old YouTube video - aging [like a fine wine](https://youtu.be/SmpkdPm9eeQ?t=1494)

## 0.1 Motivation

So you're scared shitless of the future. 

Autocracies the world over grow in power, themselves (partly) fueled by the unrelenting imperial drive of the United States.
The environment is fucked and COP-whatever-we're-on-now is as always apparently doomed to abject failure.
Governments everywhere are either unwilling to listen to the science / public / basic morality, or unable to act.
Crippled by rusting institutions savaged by decades of neoliberalism and austerity, by the 1%, by the elite, by the deep state.
There isn't much difference, fossil fuel addiction lying at the heart of 21st century militarism & capitalism.
The heart of the Blob.

You hear about the 1920s and the comparisons to today and their eerie echoes and you worry.
The Spanish Flu and Covid, the Holocaust and the Uyghur genocide just the start.
You don't want to jump to conclusions but can't help think - what could they have done differently?
What could I do differently?

Your only solace lies in the sheer unpredictability of the future, grim comfort in the flailing hubris as expert models fail to expect the unexpected.
Nothing changes like time, and in there is enough freedom to breathe.
You think and listen and talk and wonder if maybe, just maybe, an oppourtunity might arise.
A black swan at the break of dawn, some moment where by chance or by fate things can be **changed** for the better, for the long run.
An instant that may never come, but if it ever does - you leave your door open and your hall light on.

This is for you, and for me.

## 0.2 Scope

This guide is an attempt to consider the options available to the individual attempting to change policy, and their effectiveness.
Without the benefit of hindsight it is of course impossibly difficult to determine cause and effect of action.
However it should be possible to make decisions based on heuristic 'common senese' approaches. 
For example, we can safely assume that staying at home and praying for political victory, no matter how sincere, is unlikely to achieve much.
At the other extreme, massive armed insurrection against the forces of the Blob or a general strike are likely effective but hard to achieve, to say the least.

Within this matrix of the achievability/effect matrix of political action available to an **individual**, 
assumed to have at least the privalage of living somewhere within the borders of Europe & above the poverty line,
we consider as a starting point the obvious categories:
* democracy: voting, writing to your MP/MEP 
* activism, the expansion of direct effort: join a demonstration, produce propaganda, organise other people
* altruism [of the 'effective' variety](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) or some other means to convert capital into social change
* change the system from with (the system changes you)

### 0.20 Political goals

We suppose only the following assumptions about our individual and their political goals:
1. **Will to live:** the continued proliferation of arms by great powers *and* the escalating climate crisis are equally grave existential threats to humanity, and it's pretty concerning.
2. **Anti-Blob:** it's neccessary to unseat the saber-rattling child-killing oil-hungry thugs deep within our governments before they destroy us all.
3. **Skeptical pacifism:** non-violence today must be weighted against the risk of entering 2030 with another degree of warming and step closer to nuclear armegaedon - and for 2040, 2050 and so on.

### 0.21 Violence

For our purposes we consider political violence to range from damage to innanimate objects, 
up to methods common to international warfare and terrorism - in particular, directed cyberattack and income-generating cybercrime.

We can outline the political violence under discussion on a rough scale of increasing severity:
* surveillence (CCTV, tracking mobile devices, other forms of (electronic) data collection: among all primates, a hard stare is nothing if not a threat.  
* non-violent civil disobedience: protest, democratic action, etc.
* property damage: riot, sabotage, cyberattacks against (only) property
* ...
* armed conflict up to and including conventional warfare
* existential destruction, whether by some aspect of the climate crisis or the latest hypersonic glide vehicle launched nuclear warhead.

Of these kinds of violence, only the very last is to be avoided **at all costs** and especially when considering 'the long run' - say, up until 2050.
However, the lesser forms of violence (while to be avoided for their own sake) could be argued as justified and even required **for the avoidence** of the latter.

### 0.22 Software

If Marx is said to have dissected the world into the relationships between the working class and capital (and coal),
this author sees the greatest revolutionary potential in the softare binding today's world together.

Software (Engineers) today control:
* the refineries, pipelines & ships dumping fossil fuels all over the world.
* the transactions, networks & data-centres composing the global financial system.
* the drones, satilites & communications enabling armies with weapons of mass destruction to shape the planet.

The conciousness of the labour force is of course categorically _different_ between the 20th century working class and the 21st century software class
dense local communities with largely common interests toiling in dangerous & unhealthy conditions,
versus a sparse global network of (usually) comfortably paid remote workers.
Very little class solidarity exists within the tech world, with unionisation uncommon.
The prevailing attitude is one of Silicone Valley-inspired hazy techno-utopianism with a pseudo-meritocratic flavour.

However, software is real a 'force multiplier' for businesses, allowing them to connect with customers all over the globe as well as creating products for _free_ (once the initial development cost is paid).
It's not unreasonable to consider that such a multiplier might also be available to the determined politcally-minded individual, with sufficient technological grounding.
Tools of cyberwarfare/crime can cripple the health services of an entire nation, black out power grids, send ships and aeroplanes crashing.
This is where oppourtunity, if it lies anywhere, must be.

Then again, if all you know how to make is a hammer...

### 0.23 Strategy

#### TODO:

**Outeline strategic thinking:** uncertainty, chance and optionallity

**Discuss important counterfactuals:** what is the likelyhood of *not* having
 * another lockdown in the next 10 years? 
 * another refugee 'crisis'?
 * another economic crash?
 * another invasion?
 * another terrorist attack?
 
**Preparation is needed:** how to be positioned & ready before the masses next scream 'not one fucking step further'
